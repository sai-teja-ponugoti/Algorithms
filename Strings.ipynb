So the run \"AAA\" would be run-length-encoded as \"3A\".\n",

For example, the run \"AAAAAAAAAAAA\" (12 As), can't naively be encoded as \"12A\", since this string can be decoded as either \"AAAAAAAAAAAA\" or \"1AA\". Thus, long runs (runs of 10 or more characters) should be encoded in a split fashion; the aforementioned run should be encoded as \"9A3A\".\n",
