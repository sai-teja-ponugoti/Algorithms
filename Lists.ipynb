The class that you'll be photographing has an even number of students, and all these students are wearing red or blue shirts. In fact, exactly half of the class is wearing red shirts, and the other half is wearing blue shirts. You're responsible for arranging the students in two rows before taking the photo. Each row should contain the same number of the students and should adhere to the following guidelines:\n",

        "A tandem bicycle is a bicycle that's operated by two people: person A and person B. Both people pedal the bicycle, but the person that pedals faster dictates the speed of the bicycle. So if person A pedals at a speed of 5, and person B pedals at a speed of 4, the tandem bicycle moves at a speed of 5 (i.e., tandemSpeed = max(speedA, speedB)).\n",

Each rider is represented by a single positive integer, which is the speed that they pedal a tandem bicycle at. Both lists have the same length, meaning that there are as many red-shirt riders as there are blue-shirt riders. Your goal is to pair every rider wearing a red shirt with a rider wearing a blue shirt to operate a tandem bicycle.\n",
